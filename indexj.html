       <h1 class="subheader">A little about me!</h2>
       
       <p>My name is Feven, and I’m a student at Seattle Central College. I’m studying the Software Development program. I’m on my journey to be in the tech field which is interesting. To pursue a career in the IT- field has been my dream since a few years ago. I’m happy that I got the chance to learn at Seattle Central College to be a software developer. The journey isn’t always easy, but I’m working hard to reach my goal.</p>
       <p>In my free time, I love to cook food and to listen to music. I even like to walk in the nature and enjoying the view of the nature. During summer periods I enjoy cycling as well.</p>
       <p>I have a few hobbies which are painting and decorating. Painting has been my hobby since childhood. But decorating a house or a room is my hobby which I developed during my late teenage years. I like my hobbies because they keep me happy and reduce my stress.</p>
